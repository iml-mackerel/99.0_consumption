# Estimation of predation pressure on mackerel

A precise estimate of predation pressure by every single predator cannot be obtained. The goal of this script is the obtain a distribution of plausible values for a range of predators. Minimal data requirements for each predator include (rough estimates of) their abundance, diet composition and energetic need.

# Structure
Data for all predators is saved in a specific .txt format in the data directory. The hierarchy needs to follow: "data/predator_name/population_name/lifeStage_name/variable_name.txt".

# Data file specifics

# Calculations
See resdoc.

# Notes
data: core data for the analyses. these are the numbers used.
data_supp: raw data (e.g. extracted from literature or received by mail) that was reformatted
info: all info available (papers, mails, etc.)
R: R functions
Rdata: Rdata files
scripts: supporting scripts
